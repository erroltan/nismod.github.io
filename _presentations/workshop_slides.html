# Session 1a: 10:00 to 11:00

---

# 1.1. An overview of the sector [20 mins]

and infrastructure assets that characterize the sector
--

- In 3 bullet points, identify the key relationships between your table sector
and the other infrastructure sectors
--

- In 3 bullet points, identify the potential avenues for change in the sector

---

# 1.2. Opportunities and challenges [20 mins]

## Swap tables

Some challenges:

- technological change
- climate change
- population growth, migration and an ageing population
- economic growth and growing inequality

Any other suggestions?
--

- For each of these, identify the most important effect these may have on your
table sector

---

# 1.3. Infrastructure service demands

## Swap tables [20 mins]

"_An infrastructure service is the provision of an option for an activity by
operating physical facilities and accompanying human systems to convert,
store and transmit resources (physical and virtual)._" (Hall et al., 2016)
--

- Identify, and list, using __green__ post-it-notes, the top three most important
infrastructure service demands relevant to the sector.
--

model?
--

- Place the post-it-notes on the spatio-temporal grid.

---

# Coffee 11:00 to 11:15

---

# Session 1b: 11:15 to 13:00

---

    - Travel - Distance travelled to work, method of travel to work.
    - Lifestyle - Religion, health, long-term illness.
    - Personal - Ethnic group, language, marital status, sex, age.
    - Economic - Occupation, Economic Activity, Highest level qualification, hours worked, NS-SeC.
    - Migration Demographics - Flow Data, Country of birth.
- Household Demographics:
    - Travel - Number of cars/vans.
    - Households - Number of Rooms/Bedrooms, central heating, accommodation type.
    - Occupant(s) - Number of occupants, Tenure, people per room, composition (multiple ethnicities/religions), languages, occupancy rating, household type (e.g. cohabiting), Number of dependents.
    - HRP Data - Similar to Individuals.

---

# 1.4b. Drivers of service demands [20 mins]

## Swap tables

- Find the three most important infrastructure service demands on the
spatio-temporal grid
--

- Identify, and list, using __yellow__ post-it-notes, the socio-economic
drivers of the  infrastructure service demands
--

- At what temporal and spatial scale are these socio-economic drivers required
for the model?

Place the PostIt notes on the spatio-temporal grid.

---

# 1.5. Identify key metrics [20 mins]

In the wider infrastructure debate, [infrastructure performance indicators](http://research.ncl.ac.uk/ibuild/outputs/reports/ICIF&iBUILD%20Indicators%20Interim%20Summary%20Report%20Final.pdf)
 can be used to monitor:

1. whether infrastructure performance levels are maintained over time;
2. infrastructure performance levels in relation to other countries;
3. the impacts of investment.
--


On __orange__ PostIt notes, identify and list measurements of performance
(metrics) relevant to your sector.
--

- Place the metric PostIt notes in the appropriate grid squares
on the spatio-temporal grid.
--


- Together, __discuss__ how performance metrics across the sectors relate to one another?
    - What is the appropriate temporal and spatial scale at which to measure these
metrics?
    - How could measures of risk be used in the operational or planning problems?

---

# 1.6. Draw a data-flow diagram [15 mins]

## A data-flow diagram consists of four element types

<img src="../assets/img/dataflow.svg" alt="Data flow syntax" align="left" hspace="30"/>

--

- Choose a socio-economic driver
- Choose a performance metric
- Draw the diagram

--

- How is the driver stored?
- What process works on the socio-economic driver to generate an infrastructure
  service demand?
- What extra data is required in the model?
- Where is that stored?
- Are there any gaps?

---

# 1.7. Different types of data [15 mins]

## Model inputs can be categorised into:

- static model parameters - required by every instance of a model
- dynamic model parameters - parameters that change over time
- state parameters - persistent between years
- decision variables - such as assets in which investments can be made

## Model outputs could be categorised as:

- results - e.g. simulation data
- metrics - e.g. performance indicator
- accounting - e.g. emissions, financials

???

Source, spatial resolution, temporal resolution

---

# 1.8. Data schema [15 mins]

## In pairs (with someone from another sector)

Read the draft data-schema
--


In your sectors, produce one example for each of:

- an asset
- a demand hub
- a supply hub
- a service demand
- a commodity
- a condition
--


## Discuss together


Does the draft data schema cover all types of entities in your simulation model?

---

# 1.9. The spatio-temporal grid [15 mins]

## Individually, look at the spatio-temporal grid populated with Post-It notes

- Identify something that you agree with
- Identify something that you disagree with
--


## Discuss

- What have we missed out?
- Is this two-dimensional diagram a useful approximation of the issues?
- Have we identified anything we didn't know before?

---

# Lunch 13:00 to 13:30

---

# Session 2: 13:30 to 15:00

---

# 2.1. Infrastructure assets [20 mins]

## Work in pairs with someone from a different sector team

Using the draft data schema, identify and list 2 or 3 different examples
of infrastructure __assets__ for each of the sectors.

--


## Pick one asset for each sector in the pair:

- What __attributes__ are associated with this asset?
- Is the __asset__ associated with an investment decision?
- How does the availability of the asset affect system operation?
- In what year are the assets available?
- How do the asset __attributes__ affect system operation?
- What's the most appropriate spatial resolution?
- Where are the assets located?

---

# 2.2a. 'planning' versus 'simulation' [20 mins]

## __The planning problem__

- in each [decade/year]
- what to build (assets), where and when
    - how much does it cost?
    - by how much does it improve performance?

## __The simulation problem__

- within each year
- how does the system perform?
    - how much does it cost to operate?
    - does the system meet demand?

---

# 2.2b. 'planning' versus 'simulation' [20 mins]

## Discuss in pairs

- is there any investment logic in the sector model?

- does any part of the simulation not fit within a year?
    - Think in terms of _state_ - what information is required on the 1st January which is
  computed on the 31st December? e.g. reservoir level

- does your model compute costs for operating?
    - Are these important for the planning problem? e.g. capital cost intensive renewables versus
  operational cost intensive coal plants?

---

# 2.3. Strategic Investment Rules [20 mins]

## What is the relationship between operation of the sector and planning of the sector?

__Write a rule__ which relates an output or metric from the model
to a decision to invest.

This could be the form of an if-else-then statement, or a graph showing a
threshold or relationship between an output and investment.

---

# 2.4. Key decision variables [20 mins]

_A decision variable is a parameter that is associated with an investment
(or any other kind of) decision, whose value is determined by the strategic
logic layer._

The value of a decision variable can be

- pre-specified
- specified by planning rules
- automatically determined by the optimiser

Some examples:

- build a 1 GW nuclear power station in location _x_ in 2017
- reduce residential water demand (through free water widgets) by 6Ml/day in catchment _y_ in 2023

## Identify three different targets for decision variables in your sector model with some examples.

---

# 2.5. Inputs Required

## Identify three sector model inputs which are produced by

- another sector model (a dependency)
    - a price, result or metric
    - provision of an infrastructure service

- a socio-economic scenario attribute
- a change in technology
