# Session 1a: 10:00 to 11:
---

# 1. An overview of the sector [20 mins]

_Sit in groups at the sector tables_

Together:

- In 3 bullet points, outline the networks, technologies
and infrastructure assets that characterize the sector
--

- In 3 bullet points, identify the key relationships between your table sector
and the other infrastructure sectors
--

- In 3 bullet points, identify the potential avenues for change in the sector

---

# 2. Opportunities and challenges [20 mins]

Some challenges:

- technological change
- climate change
- population growth, migration and an ageing population
- economic growth and growing inequality

Any other suggestions?
--

- For each of these, identify the most important effect these may have on your
table sector

---

# 3. Key infrastructure service demands [20 mins]

"_An infrastructure service is the provision of an option for an activity by
operating physical facilities and accompanying human systems to convert,
store and transmit resources (physical and virtual)._" (Hall et al., 2016)
--

- Identify, and list, using __green__ post-it-notes, the top three most important
infrastructure service demands relevant to the sector.
--

- At what temporal and spatial scale are these service demands required in the
model?
--

- Place the post-it-notes on the spatio-temporal grid.

---
# Coffee 11:00 to 11:15
---

# Session 1b: 11:15 to 13:00
---

# 4a. Socio-economic variables

Variables available:
- Individual Demographics:
    - Travel - Distance travelled to work, method of travel to work.
    - Lifestyle - Religion, health, long-term illness.
    - Personal - Ethnic group, language, marital status, sex, age.
    - Economic - Occupation, Economic Activity, Highest level qualification, hours worked, NS-SeC.
    - Migration Demographics - Flow Data, Country of birth.
- Household Demographics:
    - Travel - Number of cars/vans.
    - Households - Number of Rooms/Bedrooms, central heating, accommodation type.
    - Occupant(s) - Number of occupants, Tenure, people per room, composition (multiple ethnicities/religions), languages, occupancy rating, household type (e.g. cohabiting), Number of dependents.
    - HRP Data - Similar to Individuals.
---

# 4b. Drivers of service demands [20 mins]

- Find the three most important infrastructure service demands on the
spatio-temporal grid
--

- Identify, and list, using __blue__ post-it-notes, the socio-economic
drivers of the  infrastructure service demands
--

- At what temporal and spatial scale are these socio-economic drivers required
for the model? Place the PostIt notes on the spatio-temporal grid.

---

# 5. Identify key metrics that measure performance of the system [20 mins]

In the wider infrastructure debate, [infrastructure performance indicators](http://research.ncl.ac.uk/ibuild/outputs/reports/ICIF&iBUILD%20Indicators%20Interim%20Summary%20Report%20Final.pdf)
 can be used to monitor:

1. whether infrastructure performance levels are maintained over time;
2. infrastructure performance levels in relation to other countries;
3. the impacts of investment.
--


On __red__ PostIt notes, identify and list measurements of performance
(metrics) relevant to your sector.
--

- Place the metric PostIt notes in the appropriate grid squares
on the spatio-temporal grid.
--

Together:

- __Discuss__ how do performance metrics across the sectors relate to one another?
    - What is the appropriate temporal and spatial scale at which to measure these
metrics?
    - How could measures of risk be used in the operational or planning problems?

---

# 6. Draw a data-flow diagram from drivers through to outputs [15 mins]

A data-flow diagram consists of four element types:

![Data flow syntax](../assets/img/dataflow.svg)

- Choose a driver (input)
- Choose a metric (output)
- Identify processes

Are there any gaps?

---

# 7. Different types of data [15 mins]
---

# 8. Data schema [15 mins]

__In pairs (with someone from another sector)__

Read the draft data-schema
--


In your sectors, produce one example for each of:

- an asset
- a demand hub
- a supply hub
- a service demand
- a commodity
- a condition
--


__Discuss together__


Does the draft data schema cover all types of entities in your simulation model?

---

# 9. The spatio-temporal grid [15 mins]

__Individually, look at the spatio-temporal grid populated with Post-It notes__

- Identify something that you agree with
- Identify something that you disagree with
--


__Discuss__

- What have we missed out?
- Is this two-dimensional diagram a useful approximation of the issues?
- Have we identified anything we didn't know before?

---

# Lunch 13:00 to 13:30

---

# Session 2: 13:30 to 15:00

---

# 1. Infrastructure assets [20 mins]

__Work in pairs with someone from a different sector team.__

Using the draft data schema, identify and list 2 or 3 different examples
of infrastructure __assets__ for each of the sectors.

--


Pick one asset for each sector in the pair:

- What __attributes__ are associated with this asset?
- Is the __asset__ associated with an investment decision?
- How does the availability of the asset affect system operation?
- In what year are the assets available?
- How do the asset __attributes__ affect system operation?
- What's the most appropriate spatial resolution?
- Where are the assets located?

---
# 2a. 'planning' versus 'simulation' [20 mins]

__The planning problem__

- in each [decade/year]
- what to build (assets), where and when
    - how much does it cost?
    - by how much does it improve performance?

__The simulation problem__

- within each year
- how does the system perform?
    - how much does it cost to operate?
    - does the system meet demand?
---

# 2b. 'planning' versus 'simulation' [20 mins]

- is there any investment logic in the sector model?

- does any part of the simulation not fit within a year?
    - Think in terms of _state_ - what information is required on the 1st January which is
  computed on the 31st December? e.g. reservoir level

- does your model compute costs for operating?
    - Are these important for the planning problem? e.g. capital cost intensive renewables versus
  operational cost intensive coal plants?


---


# 3. Strategic Investment Rules [20 mins]

## What is the relationship between operation of the sector and planning in the sector?

__Write a rule__ which relates an output or metric from the model
to a decision to invest.

This could be the form of an if-else-then statement, or a graph showing a
threshold or relationship between an output and investment.


---
# 4. Key decision variables [20 mins]

_A decision variable is a parameter that is associated with an investment
(or any other kind of) decision, whose value is determined by the strategic
logic layer._

The value of a decision variable can be

- pre-specified
- specified by planning rules
- or automatically determined by the optimiser

Some examples:

- build a 1 GW nuclear power station in location _x_ in 2017
- reduce residential water demand (through free water widgets) by 6Ml/day

Identify three different targets for decision variables in your sector model
with some examples.

---
# 5. Inputs Required

Identify three sector model inputs which are produced by

- another sector model (a dependency)

- a socio-economic scenario

- an improvement in technology
